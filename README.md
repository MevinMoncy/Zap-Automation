# Instagram Content Automation with Zapier

A no code system that automates daily Instagram posting using **Zapier**, **Google Sheets**, and the **Instagram API**, built to maintain consistency and engagement for an audience of over 45000 followers.

This project demonstrates how simple tools can be combined to create powerful, reliable workflows—freeing up time for creativity while ensuring content is delivered on schedule, every time.

## 🎯 Project Goal

To eliminate manual Instagram posting by building a fully automated, error resilient content pipeline using only no code tools.

Many creators and small teams struggle to stay consistent. This system ensures posts go live every day without fail—while reducing manual effort by over 10 hours per week.

It’s not about replacing creativity. It’s about removing the busywork so more energy can go into strategy and connection.

## 🔧 How It Works

### 1. **Content Calendar (Google Sheets)**
- A structured spreadsheet holds all post details
  - Date and time to post
  - Publicly accessible image URL
  - Caption and hashtags
  - Status (scheduled, published, failed)

### 2. **Zapier Automation (The Engine)**
- A multi step Zap runs every hour to:
  1. Check the sheet for posts scheduled within the next hour
  2. Validate image URLs and captions
  3. Publish directly to Instagram via the **Instagram Basic Display API** (connected through Zapier)
  4. Update the row with "published" status
  5. Send email alerts if the post fails

### 3. **Error Handling and Reliability**
- Retry logic for failed posts
- Email notifications for broken links or API issues
- Daily summary report sent via email
- Manual override option for urgent changes
